Field Study - desk fans and setpoint increment in an office building

The data available in this repository is from a field study where desk fans were provided for 34 open office occupants and the setpoint temperature increased over time. The study was carried out in 2022 in Florianopolis, Brazil.

The main objective of the intervention was to identify the maximum applicable temperature extension. The lessons learned from this experiment led to a publication in which, in addition to the results, guidelines are presented to help practitioners and researchers successfully implement desk fans in similar settings: office buildings with central cooling systems without heating.

The script presented in R allows the reproduction of the analysis and graphics presented in the publication.
